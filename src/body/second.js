      <h2>I'm Anthony Holder</h2>
      <p>I grew up with a passion for art, comic books, and technology. 
      In 2019 I joined the Lambda UX Design program to gain more knowledge and experience.
      <br/>
      My transition from artist to UX designer has been a fun and challenging one. 
      My new skills and mindset of helping users allows me to create designs that are modern and functional

      <br/> In my free time, I enjoy drawing, 
      listen to music, play video games, 
      and watch football (soccer).
